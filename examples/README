The example programs are not designed to be truly comprehensive.  Instead,
they're designed to show you how easy it is to write your own test harness for
TAP using C<TAPx::Parser>.

=item * tprove

This is a rough duplicate of 'prove'.  It does not provide all of the
functionality of the 'prove' program, but it can easily be extended to do so.
Instead, it shows the basics of running tests, gathering output, aggregating
results, reporting them, and so on.

The reporting could be much better, however, C<TAPx::Parser> does have
everything you need for that reporting.  I just haven't added it to C<tprove>.

=item * tprove_color

If you have C<Term::ANSIColor> installed, this program will behave like
C<tprove> except your test output lines will have different colors depending
upon their status (failures are in red, for example).  Please note that the
colors are I<ugly>.  This is to show the fine-grained control available for
handling output.

Also, this program used the callback style of interacting with
C<TAPx::Parser>.  This simplifies setting up individual, fallback, or global
handlers for all test results.
