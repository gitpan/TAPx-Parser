TODO:

    - Fix the 'exit' bug.
    - Make sure we get the right harness output with no tests run.
    - Make the 'colored' test output easier to override.
    - More tests, particularly IPC::Open3
    - Unknown callback keys should be fatal.
    - Run it against Perl's test suite (first prove, then tprove).
    - Comments and junk are also allowed *before* the plan.  Sigh.
    - The 'result' objects are currently blessing hashrefs.  This is bad.
      Instead, they should have proper getter/setters to provide future
      support for subclassing.
    - Horrible idea:  have Mac's voice synthesis tell you when tests fail :)

QUESTIONS:

    - skipped lines should always be OK?  This should be a parse error.
      According to Schwern, this behavior is undefined.
