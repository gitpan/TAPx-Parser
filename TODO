TODO:

     - in t/20-parse.t, add test lines to comments before each section
     - Add callbacks
     - Allow description transformations to be applied.
     - Figure out the namespace.
     - Currently the error messages are not quite as helpful as they could be.
       They could use line and test numbers.
     - Identify junk lines by number.

QUESTIONS:

     - skipped lines should always be OK?  This should be a parse error.
     - VMS 'not' and 'ok' on separate lines?
